# Under Pressure

An interactive VR game with a focus on storytelling through VR medium.

## About
This game was developed as part of a course during my master's (the course was called 'Interactive Storytelling and Digital Movie Making'). **The game was made with Unity and coded in C# (.NET), models where made in Blender**.

You play as a human delivery man in a submarine on an alien planet, during your deliveries, you encounter an impoverished family and an aristocrat that you let in on your ship. Later on, when an agent knocks on your ship and starts questioning you whether you have encountered an aristocrat or an impoverished family. Will you save the aristocrat or the impoverished family, or both? Based on the actions you take as a player the story will change, the player's choice changes the story's outcome.

## My contribution

Made the postprocessing effect (an underwater effect when the player gets close to the window of the submarine) for the game, and also made the submarine door model. Helped a bit with debugging the dialogue system making sure each dialogue was played correctly at the right time.
